## **Description:**
Can you get the flag?  
We know that the website files live in ``/usr/share/nginx/html/`` and the flag is at ``/flag.txt`` but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

# **Write-Up:**
We are in ``/usr/share/nginx/html/`` and want to cat the file ``/flag.txt``. We can easily access that file by using `../../../../flag.txt`.


# **FLAG:**
